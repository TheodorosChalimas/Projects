A `State` class saves the current state of the problem, that is, how many missionaries and cannibals are in each side of the river and where is the boat (left or right).

The `generateSuccessors` method checks the actions (e.g. cross a two missionaries from left to right) that can be applied to a particular state and returns the valid successor states.

The initial state of the problem is passed as input to the bread first search algorithm (class `BreadthFirstSearch`) that returns the solution to the problem.
